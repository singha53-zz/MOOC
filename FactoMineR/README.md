# Exploratory Multivariate Data Analysis

You are one of currently 1417 participants in the MOOC. Thanks for following! If you know anyone else interested in joining, it's not too late.
After having seen how to analyze tables with quantitative variables using principal components analysis, we are now going to see how to analyze contingency tables using correspondence analysis. There are 5 short course videos, with a total running time of about the same as the PCA course, followed by a video showing how to use the method with *FactoMineR* in R, and a case study video. And of course, there is a quiz at the end, as well as written and coding exercise to help all this new information sink in.
Don't forget to take a look at the questions and answers from other participants in the forum. There's lots of good information to be found there! And of course, feel free to contribute if you have a question or answer to add. Thanks to all of you for taking part.
Good luck!
