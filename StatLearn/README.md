Welcome to HumanitiesSciences's StatLearning!
---------------------------------------------

Your learning adventure with Trevor, Rob and their team begins today. The course follows closely the sequence of chapters in the course text "An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in R" (James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani - Springer 2013). Remember, this textbook is available for free online at <http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/>. The first week will be an overview of Statistical Learning, and will cover the first two chapters of the book. On each subsequent Saturday we will release the materials for a new chapter. Here is the schedule in detail:

-   Week 1: [Introduction and Overview of Statistical Learning](https://github.com/singha53/MOOC/blob/master/StatLearn/chapters1.2.md)
-   Week 2: Linear Regression
-   Week 3: Classification
-   Week 4: Resampling Methods
-   Week 5: Linear Model Selection and Regularization
-   Week 6: Moving Beyond Linearity
-   Week 7: Tree-based Methods
-   Week 8: Support Vector Machines
